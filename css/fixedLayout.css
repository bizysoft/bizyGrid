 * Requires gridLayout.css to be loaded beforehand.
 *
 * This particular implementation is a fixed layout using a fixed width 
 * center column.
 *
 * Fixed width layout may suit better if you have a combination of text and images because 
 * they all remain proportional to their containers when zoomed/resized. Content 
 * will stay in the middle, scrollbars are used if required.
 * 
 * The only cell we need to augment for a fixed layout in this example.
