 *
 * Requires gridLayout.css to be loaded beforehand.
 *
 * This particular implementation is a fluid layout, content uses the remaining percentage of 
 * screen between fixed width side spacers.
 *
 * Fluid layouts are best when you don't want your content to be lopped or scrolled horizontally 
 * when zoomed/resized.
 * 
 * Content containers will remain the same relative size horizontally to your browser 
 * window, containers will stretch with the content vertically.
 *
 * You may have more trouble with images using this layout, because the aspect ratio of 
 * cell's will change with the size of your browser window.
 *
 * The only cells we need to augment for a fluid layout in this example.
